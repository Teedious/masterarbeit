@inproceedings{Michael1996,
abstract = {Drawing ideas from previous authors, we present a new non-blocking concurrent queue algorithm and a new two-lock queue algorithm in which one enqueue and one dequeue can proceed concurrently. Both algorithms are simple, fast, and practical; we were surprised not to find them in the literature. Experiments on a 12-node SGI Challenge multiprocessor indicate that the new non-blocking queue consistently outperforms the best known alternatives; it is the clear algorithm of choice for machines that provide a universal atomic primitive (e.g. compare{\_}and{\_}swap or load{\_}linked/store{\_}conditional). The two-lock concurrent queue outperforms a single lock when several processes are competing simultaneously for access; it appears to be the algorithm of choice for busy queues on machines with non-universal atomic primitives (e.g. test{\_}and{\_}set). Since much of the motivation for non-blocking algorithms is rooted in their immunity to large, unpredictable delays in process execution, we report experimental results both for systems with dedicated processors and for systems with several processes multiprogrammed on each processor.},

@article{Murata1989,
abstract = {This is an invited tutorial-review paper on Petri nets-a graphical and mathematical modeling tool. Petri nets are a promising tool for describing and studying information processing systems that are characterized as being concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic. The paper starts with a brief review of the history and the application areas considered in the literature. It then proceeds with introductory modeling examples, behavioral and structural properties, three methods of analysis, subclasses of Petri nets and their analysis. In particular, one section is devoted to marked graphs- the concurrent system model most amenable to analysis. In addition, the paper presents introductory discussions on stochastic nets with their application to performance modeling, and on highlevel nets with their application to logic programming. Also included are recent results on reachability criteria. Suggestions are provided for further reading on many subject areas of Petri nets. {\textcopyright} 1989 IEEE},

@article{Kharitonov2020,
abstract = {The article describes an approach to detecting race conditions with respect to a variable in a program, based on the automatic construction of a program model in terms of Petri nets. A simple sample program having race condition is given and the analysis of its behavior shows four different results of execution due to the race condition. Compositional model of the program in terms of Petri nets is presented that illustrates the process of automatic model generation. Notions of program control flow, global area and environment models are introduced. Reduction rules for the control flow model are defined and compositional representation of reduced program model is described. The formula for detection of race conditions is defined as: for a race conditions to occur, it is necessary that between the moment a variable is read by a thread and the moment this thread writes to a variable, an event of writing to the variable by another thread may occur. Compositional model of global variable capable of intercepting writing to variable events that lead to race condition is presented. By synchronizing the program control flow model with the global variable model it is possible to detect race conditions by building the reachability tree and checking for the presence of error event in it.},

@book{Friesen2015,
abstract = {This concise book empowers all Java developers to master the complexity of the Java thread APIs and concurrency utilities. This knowledge aids the Java developer in writing correct and complex performing multithreaded applications. Java's thread APIs and concurrency utilities are among its most powerful and challenging APIs and language features. Java beginners typically find it very difficult to use these features to write correct multithreaded applications. Threads and the Concurrency Utilities helps all Java developers master and use these capabilities effectively. This book is divided into two parts of four chapters each. Part 1 focuses on the Thread APIs and Part 2 focuses on the concurrency utilities. In Part 1, you learn about Thread API basics and runnables, synchronization and volatility, waiting and notification, and the additional capabilities of thread groups, thread local variables, and the Timer Framework. In Part 2, you learn about concurrency utilities basics and executors, synchronizers, the Locking Framework, and the additional capabilities of concurrent collections, atomic variables, and the Fork/Join Framework. Each chapter ends with select exercises designed to challenge your grasp of the chapter's content. An appendix provides the answers to these exercises. A second appendix explores how threads are used by various standard class library APIs. Specifically, you learn about threads in the contexts of Swing, JavaFX, and Java 8's Streams API. What You Will Learn • How to do thread runnables, synchronization, volatility, waiting and notification, thread groups, thread local variables, and the Timer Framework • How to create multithreaded applications that work correctly. • What are concurrency utilities basics and executors • What are synchronizers, the Locking Framework, concurrent collections, atomic variables, and the Fork/Join Framework and how to use them • How to leverage the concurrency utilities to write more complex multithreaded applications and achieve greater performance • How to apply thread usage in Swing, JavaFX, and Java 8 Streams API contexts Audience The primary audience is Java beginners and the secondary audience is more advanced Java developers who have worked with the Thread APIs and the Concurrency Utilities. ** From the Back Cover Threads and the Concurrency Utilities helps all Java developers master the complexity of Java's Thread APIs and Java's Concurrency Utilities. This knowledge aids the Java developer in writing correct and performant multithreaded applications. Everything you want to know about Java's support for threads and concurrency in one place. Chapter exercises designed to reinforce chapter content and help the reader retain knowledge. Lambdas, the try-with-resources statement, and other modern language features are present. Standard Class Library use of threads in Swing, JavaFX, and Java 8 Streams API contexts explained.
